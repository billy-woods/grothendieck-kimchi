# Grothendieck's Kimchi

An English translation of Alexander Grothendieck's writing on kimchi formatted in HTML. I have nothing to do with its translation; I just crowdsourced/open-sourced the translation here on github. A scan of the original French can be found [here on the website of Thibault Damour](http://www.ihes.fr/~damour/IMAGE/kimchi_grothendieck.pdf).

To anyone who updates the translation, please leave notes in the next section to guide the next translator. :)
