# Grothendieck's Kimchi

An English translation of Alexander Grothendieck's writing on kimchi formatted in HTML. I have nothing to do with its translation; I just crowdsourced/open-sourced the translation here on github. A scan of the original French can be found [here on the website of Thibault Damour](http://www.ihes.fr/~damour/IMAGE/kimchi_grothendieck.pdf). A live version of this translation can be found at [math.ucr.edu/~mpierce/kimchi](http://math.ucr.edu/~mpierce/kimchi/).

To anyone who updates the translation, please leave notes in the next section of this README.md to guide the next translator. :) 

# Notes for Translatores

 - So far the file `kimchi.html` just contains an OCR rending of the original PDF in French. It's separated into sections 1â€“7, which you can see enumerated by hand in the PDF. The file is HTML because the translated version will eventually be hosted on the web, but I can take care of any HTML markup; this project primarily needs people who can translate French to English.
